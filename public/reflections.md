# Variable Declaration - It is very similar to declaring variables in different coding languages. Prior knowledge helped me to easily understand and adapt to it.
# JavaScript  Arithmetic Operations - The operations are just based on normal arithmetic. This made it very easy learn and apply.
# JavaScript Assignment Operations -  I found this topic easier than the other JavaScript operations since it worked the same way for all. For example x+=1 is x=x+1, while x*=5 is x=x*5, which made it easier to grasp.
# Printing a function output - The concept was very easy to grasp since it is similar to console.log.
# Return Statement - Learning about this was helpful in writing codes and can help create shortcuts. It is also relatively easy to learn and apply.

# JavaScript Comparison Operators -  I had a bit of trouble dealing with this but I don't think so anymore. I simply got confused with there being more than one equal sign and the different comparisons behind them.
#  For..in Loop -  This loop confused me when learning about it. I did not use it before CS3 so I had no experience and grasping the concept was a bit difficult.
# Nested Loops -  This topic was difficult for me for a few reasons. It was a bit overwhelming since two or more loops would be happening at the same time. This means more things to keep track of and make sure it is not wrong because a single mistake can cause the whole code to be wrong. The hard part for me was finding it amongst all the code.
# Custom Functions -  This one confused me since there are multiple ways for the function to be used. I had a hard time remembering which one was for declaration and expression, as well as spotting which one is used in a code.
# Number Properties - I got overwhelemed since there were many different properties and methods, as well as many different uses for them. It gave me a hard time remembering when to use a specific one.

# There are a few thing I can do to improve on these topics I am having difficulties in. I could simply practice more on the specific problems. I could also consult the teacher or classmates about something I do not understand. I can even search online for explanations for these.

# The last bonus problem I think was really effective. It helped us to work as a team and collectively think of ways to figure out the code and get the answer. Although slightly stressful, it ended up fun in the end.
# A recurring activity done in class where we discuss the topic as a group is also good. It helps us to put the topic in a way that we can beter understand it and grasp it. It also helps that our teacher checks up on us and helps us.

# There were no activities in our classes that made me feel that it was not sufficient or effective. They all had a point to them and proved to be efficient and useful. Our teacher was also very good at explaining in depth and helping us understand new concepts or expound on previous concepts.
